      <h3>Introduction</h3> 
      <p style="font-size:120%;">I am a 2nd year undergrad student at NTUA School of Architecture. This is the website i created for "ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences", a course that belongs in the 2nd semester's program. <br> A little about me is that i like to sketch, meditate, go for walks and travel. Sightseeing, visiting museums, exploring new places and trying different foods is extremely exciting for me. Most of all, i love learning about the architecture and the buildings everywhere i go. <br> In this webpage, i will be presenting my work: all the projects i did for the course during this semester. </p>

      <div class="four columns">
         <h5>1st Assignment</h5>
          <p> The first project is about getting familiar with algorithmic thinking through analysis and guide description. We had to choose a process from our everyday life, explain it with simple steps through pseudocode and flowchart, follow the instructions and record the results. I used the process of making an instant coffee and the results are shown in the picture above. </p>

        <h5>2nd Assignment</h5> 
         <p>The second project had two parts. <br> The purpose of the first part was to solve with p5.js code three out of the five given problems. After creating their script on p5.js, then we needed to analyze the process in pseudocode and flowcharts. As it is shown below, i chose to solve problem 1,3 and 4 and my solution is given underneath each result.</p>

        <p>The second part was about creating an algorithmic painting with p5.js code inspired by Sol LeWitt's artwork or trying to attempt making one of Sol LeWitt's six shapes. I chose to make my own algorithmic creation based on Sol LeWitt and wrote the instructions in pseudocode and in p5.js editor.</p>

         <p>The third project had two parts. <br> The purpose of the first part was to solve with p5.js code two given problems. After creating their script on p5.js, then we needed to describe the process and explain our code. As it is shown below, my solution for both problems is given underneath each result.</p>

        <p>The second part was about creating a computer game with p5.js code. I chose to make the Snake Game and wrote the instructions in p5.js editor.</p>
